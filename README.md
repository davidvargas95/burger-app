  ## Description
  This app allows a user to add a burger that they want to try and then "devour" it to add it to their tried burgers list. It could be used to track different burger recipes that you still want to try and what you have tried.<br>
  The true purpose of the app, however, is to showcase what can be made with Handlebars. It seems to be a simple app on the surface, but underneath it is much more complex. It uses technologies such as Express, node.js, Handlebars, and a live Heroku server.

  ## Installation
  To install this app, run "npm i" in your terminal. Once the package.json files are finished installing, simply "node server.js" to open a local instance of the application. The live version can be accessed from the deployed link listed above.

  ## Usage
  This app is to be used by anyone who wants to either log their burgers or study up on how Handlebars works.
